# 🍷 Red Wine Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the quality of red wine based on physicochemical properties.

The dataset contains several features such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, sulphates, and more.  
The target variable is wine quality, which was converted into a binary classification problem.
